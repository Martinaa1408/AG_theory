## 1. Comparative Genomics

* Compares genomes across species to identify conserved and divergent elements.
* Applications:

  * **Evolutionary biology**: reconstruct phylogenies, detect adaptive changes.
  * **Functional genomics**: conserved noncoding elements suggest regulatory roles.
  * **Pathogen genomics**: compare strains to track virulence and resistance genes.
* Tools: OrthoFinder, Mauve, synteny plots.

---

## 2. Epigenomics

* Study of heritable changes in gene expression not caused by DNA sequence changes.
* Mechanisms:

  * **DNA methylation** (5mC).
  * **Histone modifications** (acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation).
  * **Chromatin accessibility** (ATAC-seq, DNase-seq).
* Applications: development, imprinting, cancer biology.

---

## 3. Transcriptomics

* Genome-wide study of RNA transcripts.
* Technologies:

  * RNA-seq (short-read Illumina, long-read ONT/PacBio Iso-Seq).
  * Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) for cell-type resolution.
* Applications:

  * Differential gene expression.
  * Alternative splicing analysis.
  * Noncoding RNA discovery.

---

## 4. Functional Genomics

* Links genotype to phenotype using genome-wide assays.
* Approaches:

  * Gene knockouts (CRISPR, RNAi).
  * Overexpression and transgenics.
  * High-throughput screens.
* Applications: pathway discovery, drug target identification.

## 5. Applied Genomics in Biotechnology

* **Medicine**:

  * Precision medicine, cancer genomics, rare disease diagnosis.
  * Pharmacogenomics: tailoring drug response to genotypes.
* **Agriculture**:

  * Marker-assisted selection (MAS), genomic selection.
  * Engineering disease-resistant or high-yield crops.
* **Industry & environment**:

  * Synthetic biology for biofuels, enzymes.
  * Metagenomics for microbiome studies, bioremediation.

---

## 6. Large-Scale Genomic Initiatives

* Human Genome Project → foundation of genomics.
* 1000 Genomes Project: human variation.
* ENCODE: functional elements in the genome.
* Earth BioGenome Project: sequencing all eukaryotic life.

## ✅ Summary

* **Comparative genomics** reveals conserved and unique elements across species.
* **Epigenomics** studies DNA/histone modifications and chromatin states.
* **Transcriptomics** characterizes RNA landscapes at bulk and single-cell levels.
* **Functional genomics** links DNA to phenotype through perturbation studies.
* **Applied genomics** impacts medicine, agriculture, industry, and environmental sciences.
