Key Formulas & Definitions

Sequencing & Assembly
---------------------
Q-score (Phred Quality Score)
Q = -10 log10(e)
where e = probability of base call error.
Example: Q30 = 1 error per 1000 bases (99.9% accuracy).

Coverage / Depth (C)
C = (L * N) / G
L = read length, N = number of reads, G = haploid genome size.
Equivalent: Coverage = (Total assembled bases / Expected genome size) * 100.

N50
Length of the shortest contig such that, when ordered from longest to shortest, contigs sum to ≥50% of the total assembly length.

GC content (%)
(G + C) / (A + T + G + C) * 100

Breadth of coverage (%)
(Covered bases / Total target bases) * 100

Genome size from C-value
Genome size (bp) = DNA content (pg) * 0.978 * 10^9
Conversion from picograms to base pairs.

Genome size from K-mers
Gbp = (Total K-mer count) / (Average K-mer depth)


Population Genetics
-------------------
Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium
p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1
Genotype frequencies in ideal populations.

FST
FST = (HT - HS) / HT
or
FST = Var(p) / [p̄(1 - p̄)]
Measures genetic differentiation between populations.

D (LD coefficient)
D = PAB - pA * pB
Linkage disequilibrium between alleles A and B.

H² (Broad-sense heritability)
H² = VG / VP
Ratio of genetic variance to phenotypic variance.

h² (Narrow-sense heritability)
h² = VA / VP
Ratio of additive genetic variance to phenotypic variance.

Breeder’s equation (Response to selection)
R = h² * S
R = response, h² = narrow-sense heritability, S = selection differential.

Recombination frequency
1 centiMorgan (cM) ≈ 1% recombination ≈ 1/100 meioses.


Statistics & Genomics
---------------------
P-value threshold (Bonferroni correction)
pthreshold = α / Ntests

FDR (False Discovery Rate, Benjamini–Hochberg)
qi = (i / m) * α
where i = rank, m = number of tests.

Manhattan plot (GWAS significance)
y = -log10(p)
Visualizes SNP association p-values.

CNV signal
log2(Sample intensity / Reference intensity)
Used to detect copy-number variation.

FROH (Runs of Homozygosity)
FROH = (Length of all ROHs (Mb)) / (Total autosomal genome length (Mb))
Estimator of inbreeding.
