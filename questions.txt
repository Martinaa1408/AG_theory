### **What are Mendel‚Äôs two laws and what ratios do they predict?**

* **Law of Segregation**: each individual has two alleles per gene, which separate during gamete formation. Each gamete receives one allele.

  * *Example*: a heterozygote (Aa) produces 50% gametes with A and 50% with a.
  * *Phenotypic ratio*: in F2 of a monohybrid cross (Aa √ó Aa) you see **3:1** dominant\:recessive.
* **Law of Independent Assortment**: alleles of different genes assort independently if the genes are on different chromosomes (or far apart on the same chromosome).

  * *Example*: in a dihybrid cross (AaBb √ó AaBb), gametes are produced in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.
  * *Phenotypic ratio*: in F2 you get **9:3:3:1**.
* **Why important?** These laws underpin classical genetics and are the starting point for linkage, recombination mapping, and population genetics.

---

### **How does crossing-over allow genetic mapping?**

* Crossing-over = physical exchange of chromosome segments between homologs in **meiosis I**.
* If two genes are close on a chromosome, they are rarely separated by crossing-over ‚Üí low recombination frequency.
* If two genes are far apart, crossovers occur between them more often ‚Üí high recombination frequency.
* *Recombination frequency (RF)* is proportional to physical distance, measured in **centiMorgans (cM)**.
* **Why useful?** You can map the relative position of genes without seeing the DNA, just by analyzing recombination in offspring.

---

### **What is recombination frequency and how is it measured?**

* RF = (# recombinant offspring) √∑ (total offspring) √ó 100.
* 1% recombinants = 1 cM genetic distance.
* Example: if 20 recombinants out of 200 offspring ‚Üí RF = 10% ‚Üí genes are \~10 cM apart.
* **Limitation**: for very distant genes, recombination approaches 50%, making them appear unlinked.

---

### **What is a pedigree and what information does it provide?**

* A pedigree is a family tree diagram using standardized symbols to represent individuals and inheritance of traits.
* *Uses*:

  * Identify inheritance pattern (dominant, recessive, X-linked, mitochondrial).
  * Estimate recurrence risk of genetic diseases.
  * Track carriers and affected individuals.
* **Why useful?** It is a practical tool in human genetics where controlled crosses (like Mendel‚Äôs peas) are impossible.

---

### **What is cytogenetics and what stage of the cell cycle is used?**

* Cytogenetics = study of chromosome structure, number, and function using microscopy.
* Uses **metaphase chromosomes** (most condensed state).
* Techniques: karyotyping, FISH, spectral karyotyping.
* Applications: detecting aneuploidies (e.g., trisomy 21), structural abnormalities (deletions, duplications, translocations).

---

### **Define genotype, phenotype, and heritability.**

* **Genotype**: genetic constitution (e.g., Aa, G/G).
* **Phenotype**: observable trait (e.g., tall plant, blue eyes, blood pressure).
* **Heritability (h¬≤)**: proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genetic variance in a population.

  * $h^2 = V_G / V_P$.
  * *Example*: If height variance in a population is 80% genetic, h¬≤ = 0.8.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è *Important*: heritability is population-specific; it does not mean ‚Äútrait is 80% genetic in an individual.‚Äù

---

### **What are the assumptions of Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg equilibrium (HWE)?**

* Infinite population size (no drift).
* Random mating.
* No mutation.
* No migration (no gene flow).
* No selection.
* **Formula**: $p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$.
* **Why useful?** Provides a null model for allele and genotype frequencies. Deviations suggest evolutionary forces at work.

---

### **Give one real-life factor that violates HWE.**

* Non-random mating (inbreeding, assortative mating).
* Genetic drift in small populations.
* Migration (admixture).
* Natural selection (fitness differences).
* Mutation (introducing new alleles).

---
### **haplotypes**

* A haplotype is a set of alleles (variants) that are inherited together on the same chromosome segment.
* Instead of looking at each SNP independently, a haplotype represents a specific combination of variants across a genomic region.
* Haplotypes capture the fact that recombination is not completely random: nearby variants tend to be transmitted together because they are physically linked.

---

### **What is linkage disequilibrium and why is it useful in GWAS?**

* **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)** = non-random association of alleles at two loci.
* Occurs when alleles are inherited together more often than expected by chance due to physical proximity.
* **In GWAS**: SNPs are markers, not usually causal. But if they are in LD with causal variants, they can act as ‚Äútags.‚Äù
* *Example*: If SNP A is in perfect LD with a causal SNP, detecting A in GWAS reveals association with the trait.

---

### **What is a ROH and what does it indicate in a population?**

* ROH = Run of Homozygosity, a long stretch of homozygous genotypes in the genome.
* Indicates parents shared a common ancestor (inbreeding).
* *Applications*: measure inbreeding coefficient, identify selection sweeps.

---

### **What does F\_ST measure and what are its extremes (0 vs 1)?**

* F\_ST = fixation index ‚Üí degree of allele frequency differentiation among populations.
* 0 = no differentiation (identical populations).
* 1 = complete separation (fixed for different alleles).
* *Application*: used in population genetics, conservation, and detecting local adaptation.

---

### **What is the difference between additive and dominance genetic variance?**

* **Additive variance (VA)**: contribution of individual alleles, sum of effects ‚Üí most predictable.
* **Dominance variance (VD)**: due to interaction between alleles at the same locus (dominant vs recessive).
* **Epistatic variance (VI)**: due to interactions between different loci.

---

### **Give the formula decomposing phenotypic variance.**

* $V_P = V_A + V_D + V_I + V_E$.

  * $V_A$: additive.
  * $V_D$: dominance.
  * $V_I$: epistasis.
  * $V_E$: environment.

---

### **What is the central dogma of molecular biology?**

* Flow of information: DNA ‚Üí RNA ‚Üí Protein.
* Replication: DNA ‚Üí DNA.
* Transcription: DNA ‚Üí RNA.
* Translation: RNA ‚Üí protein.
* Exceptions: reverse transcription (retroviruses), non-coding RNAs (not translated).

---

### **What is PLINK and what types of files does it use?**

* A widely used toolset for GWAS and population genomics.
* Input formats:

  * **Text-based**: .ped (genotypes), .map (markers).
  * **Binary**: .bed (binary genotypes), .bim (marker info), .fam (family/phenotype info).
* Functions: filtering SNPs by call rate, MAF, HWE; association testing; LD pruning; ROH detection.

# üß¨ Chapter 2 ‚Äî Sequencing Technologies (Very Expanded Answers)

---

### **What is SBS and which platform uses it?**

* **Sequencing by Synthesis (SBS)** is the principle behind **Illumina sequencing**, the most widely used NGS technology today.
* The DNA template is attached to a flow cell and amplified into clusters using **bridge amplification**.
* Special **nucleotides with fluorescent labels and reversible terminators** are added. Each incorporation by DNA polymerase is detected by a camera that records the color (red/green/blue/yellow) corresponding to A, T, C, or G.
* After imaging, the fluorescent dye and the terminator group are cleaved, allowing the next nucleotide to be incorporated.
* This **cyclical process** continues base by base, building the read sequence in real time.
* **Advantages**: very accurate (error rate <0.1%), cost per base is low, extremely high throughput (billions of reads).
* **Limitations**: reads are short (100‚Äì300 bp), which makes assembly of repetitive genomes difficult.
* **Application**: resequencing human genomes, RNA-seq, single-cell sequencing.

---

### **What is emulsion PCR and which platforms use it?**

* **emPCR** is a method to amplify single DNA fragments inside tiny **water-in-oil droplets**, each acting like an independent microreactor.
* Each droplet contains: one DNA fragment, a bead with primers, and PCR reagents.
* After PCR cycles, the bead becomes coated with **millions of identical copies** of the DNA fragment.
* The beads are then deposited on a plate (Roche 454) or semiconductor chip (Ion Torrent).
* Platforms that used it: **Roche 454, Ion Torrent, SOLiD**.
* **Why needed?** The sequencing signal from a single molecule is too weak; amplification makes detection possible.
* **Limitations**: introduces bias (over- or under-representing fragments), more complex library prep compared to Illumina.

---

### **What is bridge amplification and in which platform is it used?**

* Illumina uses **bridge amplification** on its flow cells.
* Each DNA fragment is ligated with adapters that bind to primers fixed on the glass surface.
* The DNA bends and hybridizes to a nearby primer, forming a ‚Äúbridge.‚Äù PCR then generates a **cluster** of identical fragments at that spot.
* Each cluster produces a strong fluorescent signal during sequencing.
* **Advantage**: millions of clusters can be generated in parallel, increasing throughput dramatically.
* **Limitation**: amplification errors can occur; requires precise surface chemistry.

-->graphical of density depends of chemical channel
---

### **What is pyrosequencing and which platform used it?**

* Pyrosequencing was the principle of **Roche 454 sequencing**.
* When DNA polymerase incorporates a nucleotide, **pyrophosphate (PPi)** is released.
* PPi triggers a cascade of enzymatic reactions:

  1. PPi is converted to ATP by ATP sulfurylase.
  2. ATP drives luciferase to emit light.
* The light intensity is measured and corresponds to the number of identical nucleotides incorporated (e.g., AAA gives a stronger signal).
* **Advantage**: longer reads than early Illumina (400‚Äì700 bp).
* **Limitation**: very expensive, homopolymer errors (difficult to distinguish 6 A‚Äôs from 7 A‚Äôs). Roche discontinued the platform in 2016.

4 enzyme: lucyferase, PPi ....

---

### **What signal is detected in Ion Torrent sequencing?**

* Ion Torrent uses a **semiconductor chip**.
* Each well contains a DNA-coated bead.
* When DNA polymerase incorporates a nucleotide, a **hydrogen ion (H+)** is released, lowering the pH.
* This pH change is detected as an electrical signal.
* **Advantages**: no expensive optics (cameras, lasers) ‚Üí cheaper and faster.
* **Limitations**: prone to homopolymer errors because the signal intensity is not linear with base number.

PCR emulsion, library prep (adaptator + seq); omopolymers, peaks irregular, polyclonal (more sequences mixed form 2 different fragments, no missed space)
in Illumina block terminal (capture sequencing for fluorescence)
---

### **Strengths and weaknesses of Illumina vs Ion Torrent**

* **Illumina**:

  * Strengths: industry standard, extremely accurate, very high throughput, huge bioinformatics support.
  * Weaknesses: short reads, slower turnaround than Ion Torrent, expensive machines.
* **Ion Torrent**:

  * Strengths: fast, cheaper equipment, easy workflow.
  * Weaknesses: high error rate in homopolymer stretches, lower throughput than Illumina.
* **Bottom line**: Illumina dominates large projects (genomes, transcriptomics); Ion Torrent is used in smaller labs or diagnostic settings where speed matters more than perfect accuracy.

---

### **What error type is Ion Torrent especially prone to?**

* **Homopolymer errors** (AAAA vs AAAAA).
* Because the signal is based on pH change, the system struggles to quantify exactly how many nucleotides were added if the same base is repeated multiple times.

---

### **What is the typical read length of Illumina short reads?**

* **100‚Äì150 bp paired-end** (most common, e.g., HiSeq, NovaSeq).
* Up to **300 bp paired-end** on MiSeq (used for amplicon sequencing, e.g., 16S).

---

### **What is the typical read length of PacBio HiFi?**

* HiFi = high-fidelity circular consensus reads.
* Typically **10‚Äì25 kb** with accuracy >99%.
* Older CLR reads were longer (>30 kb) but error-prone.
* **Applications**: de novo assembly of complex genomes, isoform sequencing, structural variants.

SMRT sequencing is specific to PacBio, based on real-time fluorescent detection of nucleotide incorporation. 
Nanopore sequencing is specific to Oxford Nanopore, based on ionic current changes through nanopores. 
Both are long-read methods, but they use distinct technologies.

A Zero-Mode Waveguide (ZMW) is a nanophotonic chamber used in PacBio SMRT sequencing. 
Each ZMW holds a single DNA polymerase at its base. It confines light to a tiny observation volume, allowing real-time detection of fluorescently labeled nucleotide incorporations at the single-molecule level.
ZMWs are the core technology that makes PacBio‚Äôs long, high-fidelity reads possibl

---

### **What is the main advantage of Nanopore sequencing?**

* Can generate **ultra-long reads** (hundreds of kb, even >1 Mb).
* **Real-time sequencing**: data can be analyzed as it‚Äôs produced.
* Portable: MinION is the size of a USB stick, useful in fieldwork (e.g., Ebola outbreak, space station).
* Can also detect **epigenetic modifications** (methylation) directly, without chemical treatment.

---

### **What is the main limitation of Nanopore sequencing?**

* Historically had high error rates (5‚Äì15%), though much improved with new chemistries and AI basecalling.
* Requires **very high molecular weight DNA** ‚Üí extraction is tricky.
* Yield depends heavily on sample quality and preparation.

-->RNA cDNA required
---

### **Which platforms require DNA polymerase in sequencing-by-synthesis?**

* Illumina (fluorescent detection).
* Roche 454 (light detection via pyrophosphate).
* Ion Torrent (pH detection).
* SOLiD (ligation-based, slightly different but still uses enzymatic incorporation).

---

### **What is a mate-pair library and what is it used for?**

* Constructed by circularizing long DNA fragments (2‚Äì20 kb), then cutting and sequencing ends.
* Produces read pairs that are **far apart** in the genome.
* Useful for scaffolding assemblies, detecting structural variants, resolving repeats.

---

### **What is paired-end sequencing and how does it differ from mate-pair?**

* Paired-end: both ends of **short inserts** (\~200‚Äì600 bp) are sequenced.
* Mate-pair: both ends of **long inserts** (2‚Äì20 kb) are sequenced after circularization.
* Both provide information about orientation and distance between reads.

---

### **What is multiplexing/barcoding and why is it used?**

* Unique index sequences (barcodes) are ligated to DNA fragments of each sample.
* Different samples can be mixed in one sequencing run.
* After sequencing, reads are sorted (demultiplexed) by barcode.
* Saves cost, increases throughput.

---

### **Why is long-read sequencing essential for repeat-rich genomes?**

* Short reads cannot span long repetitive elements (transposons, rDNA arrays, satellite DNA).
* Assemblies collapse repeats into gaps or misassemblies.
* Long reads can span entire repeats, producing more continuous assemblies.

---

### **Why is Illumina still widely used despite long-read technologies?**

* Illumina has:

  * **Highest accuracy** (gold standard for SNP calling).
  * **Lowest cost per base**.
  * **Massive throughput** (billions of reads per run).
* Long reads are powerful but more expensive, lower throughput, and still require Illumina polishing in many cases.

# üß¨ Chapter 3 ‚Äî Data & Formats (Expanded Answers, in English)

---

### **What is a FASTQ file and what does each line represent?**

* A FASTQ file is the **standard format for raw NGS sequencing data**.
* Each sequencing read is represented by **4 lines**:

  1. **Identifier line**, starts with `@` (e.g., `@Read001`).
  2. **Nucleotide sequence** (A, T, C, G).
  3. **Separator line** `+` (may or may not repeat the identifier).
  4. **Quality string** (ASCII-encoded Phred scores, one character per base).
* Example:

  ```
  @SEQ_ID
  GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGT
  +
  !''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*
  ```
* This format is fundamental because it contains both the **biological information** (the sequence) and the **technical reliability** (the quality scores).

---

### **What is a Phred quality score and how is it calculated?**

* The **Phred score (Q)** represents the probability that a base is called incorrectly.
* Formula:

  $$
  Q = -10 \log_{10}(P_{error})
  $$
* Examples:

  * Q10 = 90% accuracy (1 error per 10 bases).
  * Q20 = 99% accuracy (1 error per 100 bases).
  * Q30 = 99.9% accuracy (1 error per 1,000 bases).
* Widely used as a universal quality measure in sequencing data.

---

### **What is a good Q-score threshold for high-confidence bases?**

* **Q30** is considered the gold standard.
* This means there is only a 0.1% chance of error in each base call.
* In most genomics projects, the majority of bases should reach at least Q30 for data to be considered reliable.

---

### **What is the difference between SAM and BAM files?**

* After aligning reads to a reference genome, results are stored in either:

  * **SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map)**: human-readable, plain text, very large size, slower to process.
  * **BAM (Binary Alignment/Map)**: compressed binary version of SAM, much smaller, faster, and indexable.
* Both formats contain information such as read ID, mapping position, mapping quality, and the **CIGAR string** describing mismatches, insertions, deletions, or clipping during alignment.

---

### **What is the advantage of BAM over SAM?**

* **Efficiency**: BAM takes much less storage space.
* **Speed**: BAM can be indexed, allowing random access to a specific genomic region without reading the whole file.
* This is why nearly all downstream bioinformatics tools require BAM instead of SAM.

---

### **What is a VCF file and what does it contain?**

* **VCF (Variant Call Format)** is the standard for storing genetic variants.
* Main columns include:

  1. Chromosome.
  2. Position.
  3. Reference allele.
  4. Alternative allele(s).
  5. Quality score of the variant call.
  6. Filter status (PASS or fail).
  7. INFO (extra annotations such as allele frequency, functional impact).
  8. FORMAT (genotype information fields).
  9. Sample genotypes (e.g., 0/0, 0/1, 1/1).
* **Why important?** It encodes all SNPs, indels, and structural variants in a standardized way, making it essential for GWAS and population genomics.

---

### **What is a GFF file and what is it used for?**

* **General Feature Format (GFF)** is a file format that describes genome annotation features.
* Each row specifies: chromosome, start, end, strand, feature type (gene, exon, intron, UTR, etc.), and attributes.
* Used to connect **coordinates** in the genome with **biological meaning**.

---

### **What is the difference between BED and GFF?**

* **BED**: simple format containing genomic intervals (chromosome, start, end). Used for quick coordinate-based operations and visualization.
* **GFF/GTF**: more descriptive, stores full structural annotation of genes and transcripts.

---

### **What is FastQC and why is it the first step in analysis?**

* **FastQC** is a quality-control tool for raw sequencing data.
* It checks:

  * Distribution of Phred quality scores per base.
  * GC content (should match expected genome composition).
  * Overrepresented sequences (often adapters or contamination).
  * Read length distribution.
* **Why first step?** It immediately shows whether your sequencing run is usable or needs cleaning (e.g., trimming adapters, filtering poor-quality reads).

---

### **What is adapter trimming and why is it important?**

* During library preparation, adapters are ligated to fragments. Sometimes the sequencer reads into the adapter sequence.
* If adapters are not removed:

  * Reads may map incorrectly.
  * Variant calling is biased.
  * Artificial SNPs are introduced.
* Tools: **Cutadapt, Trimmomatic, fastp**.

---

### **What is mapping quality (MAPQ) and why filter by it?**

* MAPQ is a score that indicates how confidently a read was mapped to the genome.
* High MAPQ = read uniquely aligned.
* Low MAPQ = read maps equally well to multiple positions (common in repetitive regions).
* Filtering ensures that only reliable alignments are used in downstream analyses like SNP calling.

---

### **What is duplicate marking and why is it performed?**

* PCR during library prep can produce duplicate reads of the same fragment.
* Without marking duplicates, a variant may appear to be supported by more reads than truly exist.
* Tools like **Picard** or **GATK** mark duplicates so they don‚Äôt inflate allele frequency or coverage estimates.

---

### **What tools are commonly used for alignment of short reads?**

* **BWA-MEM**: gold standard for DNA resequencing.
* **Bowtie2**: fast, good for short-read alignment.
* **HISAT2**: optimized for RNA-seq with spliced alignments.

Bowtie is faster and best for very short reads with minimal indels, while BWA is slower but more accurate for longer reads and variant calling. 
In practice, BWA-MEM is the gold standard for genome resequencing, whereas Bowtie is often used for ChIP-seq and other applications needing speed over complex alignment.

---

### **What tools are commonly used for variant calling?**

* **GATK HaplotypeCaller**: industry standard for SNPs and indels.
* **FreeBayes**: alternative, works well for pooled samples.
* **SAMtools mpileup**: older but still widely used.

---

### **Why is depth/coverage important in variant calling?**

* **Coverage** = average number of reads covering each base.
* Higher coverage = higher confidence in detecting true variants.
* Typical standards:

  * 30√ó for whole human genomes.
  * 50‚Äì100√ó for exomes.
  * > 100√ó for microbial genomes.
* Too low ‚Üí false negatives.
* Too high (e.g., >500√ó) ‚Üí may indicate PCR artifacts or duplications.

---

### **Why are structural variants harder to detect with short reads?**

* Short reads (\~150 bp) cannot span large insertions, deletions, or rearrangements.
* Breakpoints often lie in repetitive regions, where short reads map poorly.
* **Solutions**: long-read sequencing (PacBio, Nanopore), mate-pair libraries, optical mapping, Hi-C scaffolding.

---

# üß¨ Chapter 4 ‚Äî Genome Assembly (Expanded Answers)

---

### **What is the difference between OLC and de Bruijn graph assembly?**

* **OLC (Overlap‚ÄìLayout‚ÄìConsensus)**:

  * Works by aligning reads to find pairwise overlaps.
  * Constructs a graph where nodes = reads and edges = overlaps.
  * Produces a layout of reads, then consensus sequence.
  * **Best for** long, accurate reads (Sanger, PacBio HiFi).
  * **Pros**: handles sequencing errors better when reads are long.
  * **Cons**: computationally very heavy for billions of short reads (all-vs-all comparisons).

* **De Bruijn graph**:

  * Breaks reads into **k-mers**.
  * Nodes = k-mers, edges = overlap of k‚Äì1 bases.
  * Paths through the graph reconstruct the genome.
  * **Best for** short reads (Illumina).
  * **Pros**: very efficient for massive data.
  * **Cons**: sensitive to sequencing errors (introduce bubbles and branches).

* **Summary**:

  * OLC ‚Üí fewer, longer, accurate reads.
  * de Bruijn ‚Üí billions of short reads.

---

### **Why is de Bruijn graph better for short reads?**

* Short reads contain too little information for reliable pairwise overlaps.
* De Bruijn avoids expensive all-vs-all alignment by using k-mers.
* Efficient at compressing data: 10‚Åπ Illumina reads become millions of unique k-mers.
* Handles uniform coverage well.

---

### **Why is OLC better for long reads?**

* Long reads (10‚Äì20 kb) make overlaps unambiguous.
* Pairwise alignment of long reads is computationally feasible (millions vs billions).
* Long reads can tolerate sequencing errors because overlaps are long enough to find true matches.

---

### **What is N50 and what does it measure?**

* N50 = a metric of assembly contiguity.
* Definition: length L such that 50% of the genome is contained in contigs/scaffolds **‚â• L**.
* Example: if genome size = 100 Mb and N50 = 5 Mb, then 50% of the genome is in contigs ‚â•5 Mb.
* **Why useful?** Summarizes distribution of contig sizes in one number.
* **Limitation**: high N50 ‚â† correct assembly (misjoins can inflate N50).

---

### **Why is N50 insufficient as the only quality metric?**

* N50 only measures contiguity, not correctness.
* A misassembled genome can have very high N50.
* Needs to be complemented with **BUSCO, read mapping, and synteny checks**.

---

### **What is BUSCO and what does it measure?**

* **BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs)**.
* Compares the genome against a set of highly conserved, single-copy genes expected in nearly all species of a clade (e.g., fungi, eukaryotes).
* Outputs:

  * Complete (single or duplicated).
  * Fragmented.
  * Missing.
* **Why useful?** Provides a biological measure of completeness: if essential genes are missing, the assembly is incomplete.
* **Example**: A good fungal genome might show >95% complete BUSCOs.

---

### **What categories of BUSCO output exist?**

1. **Complete ‚Äì Single-copy**: ortholog found once, as expected.
2. **Complete ‚Äì Duplicated**: ortholog found multiple times (possible assembly duplication or true gene family expansion).
3. **Fragmented**: partial gene present.
4. **Missing**: gene not found (gap, poor assembly, or biological absence).

---

### **What is a contig vs a scaffold?**

* **Contig**: continuous sequence assembled from overlapping reads, no gaps.
* **Scaffold**: larger sequence formed by ordering and orienting contigs using long-range information (mate-pairs, Hi-C, optical maps), gaps filled with Ns.

---

### **What is scaffolding and what technologies support it?**

* Scaffolding = linking contigs together into larger structures using information about distance and orientation.
* **Technologies**:

  * Mate-pair reads.
  * Long reads (PacBio/Nanopore).
  * Hi-C (chromatin contacts).
  * Optical mapping (Bionano).
* Produces chromosome-scale assemblies.

---

### **What is polishing in genome assembly?**

* After initial assembly, errors remain (indels, substitutions).
* Polishing = correcting errors by aligning raw reads back to assembly.
* **Tools**: Pilon (Illumina polishing), Racon, Medaka.
* **Why important?** Improves base accuracy, critical for coding regions.

---

### **What is hybrid assembly and why is it used?**

* Combines **long reads** (resolve repeats, structure) with **short reads** (high accuracy).
* Long reads build scaffolds, short reads polish errors.
* Best strategy when long-read coverage is limited or error-prone.

---

### **What is a reference-guided assembly and when is it used?**

* Uses a closely related reference genome to order and orient contigs.
* **When used**: when a reference is available and species are closely related.
* **Pros**: faster, easier, more complete.
* **Cons**: introduces reference bias; novel regions may be missed.

---

### **What is a de novo assembly and when is it required?**

* Assembly without reference, using only the reads.
* **Required when** no close reference exists (new species, metagenomics).
* More computationally challenging, but unbiased.

---

### **What are the main challenges of assembling plant or fungal genomes?**

* **High repeat content** (transposons).
* **Polyploidy** and heterozygosity.
* **Large genome size** (plants can be >10 Gb).
* Fungal genomes: moderate size but often full of repetitive elements and accessory chromosomes.

---

### **What is coverage depth and what does 30x mean?**

* **Coverage** = average number of times each base is sequenced.
* Formula: Coverage = (total bases sequenced) √∑ (genome size).
* Example: human genome 3 Gb, sequenced 90 Gb ‚Üí 30x coverage.
* **Why important?** Higher coverage increases confidence in assembly and variant calling.

---

### **Why is high-molecular-weight DNA important for long-read sequencing?**

* PacBio and Nanopore require very long DNA fragments to produce long reads.
* Sheared or degraded DNA results in short reads ‚Üí defeats the purpose.
* Extraction methods are critical (gentle handling, avoid shearing).

---

### **What is Hi-C scaffolding and what does it capture?**

* Hi-C captures **3D contacts of chromatin in the nucleus**.
* Reads from physically close regions of the genome are sequenced together.
* Provides chromosome-scale scaffolding: contigs that interact often are placed together in order.

---

### **What are typical downstream QC checks after assembly?**

* N50 and contig length distribution.
* BUSCO completeness.
* Mapping raw reads back ‚Üí % mapped, coverage uniformity.
* Check for contamination (e.g., bacterial contigs in eukaryotic genome).
* Synteny with related genomes.

# üß¨ Chapter 5 ‚Äî Genome Annotation (Expanded Answers)

---

### **What is genome annotation and why is it important?**

* Genome annotation is the process of assigning **biological meaning** to raw DNA sequences.
* After assembly, you only have a string of A, T, C, G with no information about what the sequences do.
* Annotation identifies **genes, exons, introns, promoters, regulatory elements, repeats, and functional domains**.
* Importance:

  * Transforms raw sequence into a **functional genome map**.
  * Enables biological interpretation: which genes are present, what proteins they encode, which pathways exist.
  * Essential for downstream studies such as transcriptomics, comparative genomics, and biotechnology applications.

---

### **What are the two main strategies for gene prediction?**

1. **Ab initio prediction**

   * Uses statistical models and machine learning to detect gene-like patterns in DNA.
   * Looks for open reading frames (ORFs), start/stop codons, splice sites, codon usage, GC content.
   * Example tool: **AUGUSTUS**.
   * Pros: can predict genes even without external evidence.
   * Cons: may overpredict or miss genes, especially in poorly studied organisms.

2. **Evidence-based (extrinsic) prediction**

   * Uses experimental data such as **RNA-seq reads, ESTs, or protein homology** to support gene structures.
   * Example: align transcripts to genome to define exons/introns.
   * Pros: more accurate when evidence is available.
   * Cons: requires high-quality transcriptome or protein databases.

* **Best practice**: combine both approaches in an **integrated pipeline**.

---

### **What is AUGUSTUS and what does it do?**

* **AUGUSTUS** is one of the most widely used ab initio gene prediction tools.
* Uses hidden Markov models (HMMs) trained on known genomes to identify coding regions, introns, UTRs, and alternative transcripts.
* Outputs gene models in GFF format.
* **Strength**: can be trained on a new organism to improve accuracy.
* **Limitation**: purely ab initio predictions may include false positives.

---

### **What is MAKER and how is it used?**

* **MAKER** is a **genome annotation pipeline** that integrates multiple evidence sources.
* Combines ab initio predictions (e.g., AUGUSTUS, SNAP) with:

  * Homology-based annotation (BLAST against known proteins).
  * Transcriptome evidence (RNA-seq alignments).
* Produces consensus gene models with higher confidence.
* Widely used for annotating **non-model organisms**.

---

### **What is the difference between structural and functional annotation?**

* **Structural annotation**:

  * Identifies genomic elements: genes, exons, introns, UTRs, repeats, noncoding RNAs.
  * Tools: AUGUSTUS, MAKER, GeneMark.

* **Functional annotation**:

  * Assigns **biological roles** to predicted genes.
  * Uses databases like **Pfam (domains), InterPro, UniProt, CAZy (enzymes), GO terms (Gene Ontology)**.
  * Example: a predicted gene with a glycosyl hydrolase domain is annotated as a potential cellulase.

---

### **What is Pfam and why is it important?**

* **Pfam** is a database of protein families represented by conserved domains and motifs.
* Tools scan predicted proteins for Pfam domains using hidden Markov models.
* Importance:

  * Detects functional modules in proteins.
  * Allows annotation even if the protein is novel (domain homology instead of full-sequence homology).

---

### **What are CAZymes and how are they annotated?**

* **CAZymes (Carbohydrate-Active enZymes)** are enzymes involved in building, breaking, and modifying carbohydrates.
* Families include glycoside hydrolases, glycosyl transferases, polysaccharide lyases, carbohydrate esterases, and auxiliary activity enzymes.
* Annotation done using the **CAZy database** and tools like dbCAN.
* Importance: critical in fungal and microbial genomics to study biomass degradation, symbiosis, or pathogenesis.

---

### **What is evidence-based annotation and what kind of data does it use?**

* Uses real biological evidence to support predictions:

  * **RNA-seq**: aligned transcripts reveal exon-intron boundaries.
  * **ESTs (Expressed Sequence Tags)**: short cDNA fragments showing expressed regions.
  * **Protein homology**: conserved proteins mapped from related species.
* Provides direct proof that a predicted gene is real and expressed.

---

### **What is orthology-based annotation and how is it applied?**

* Orthology = genes in different species that originated from a common ancestor.
* Orthology-based annotation transfers functional information from well-annotated organisms to new genomes.
* Tools: **OrthoFinder, OrthoMCL, eggNOG**.
* Example: If a gene in yeast is annotated as a ribosomal protein, the ortholog in a new fungus can be annotated with the same function.

---

### **What is OrthoFinder and what does it produce?**

* **OrthoFinder** is a tool for inferring orthologous groups (orthogroups) across multiple species.
* Produces:

  * Orthogroups = sets of genes descended from a single ancestor.
  * Phylogenetic trees.
  * Gene duplication/loss histories.
* **Importance**: identifies gene families, detects expansions (e.g., pathogenicity-related genes), and supports comparative genomics.

---

### **What is an orthogroup and how is it different from a Pfam domain?**

* **Orthogroup**: evolutionary grouping ‚Äî all genes from different species that descended from one ancestral gene.
* **Pfam domain**: structural/functional module within a protein.
* Difference: orthogroup = evolutionary unit; Pfam = functional/structural motif.

---

### **What is the role of noncoding RNAs in genome annotation?**

* Annotation should include not only protein-coding genes but also:

  * tRNAs (tools: tRNAscan-SE).
  * rRNAs.
  * Small RNAs (miRNAs, siRNAs).
* These are crucial for regulation, translation, and genome stability.

---

### **Why is manual curation still important in genome annotation?**

* Automated pipelines make mistakes: merge genes, split exons incorrectly, miss pseudogenes.
* Manual inspection by experts (often using genome browsers like Apollo or JBrowse) is needed to refine and validate predictions.

---

### **What are the major challenges in genome annotation?**

* Fragmented assemblies ‚Üí incomplete genes.
* High repeat content ‚Üí false predictions.
* Lack of close reference ‚Üí harder to assign function.
* Non-model organisms ‚Üí limited training datasets.

---

### **What is the RNA-seq pipeline and what are its main steps?**

* **RNA-seq** is used to study gene expression by sequencing the transcriptome.
* The **typical pipeline**:

  1. **RNA extraction** from cells/tissues.
  2. **Library preparation**: mRNA enrichment (polyA selection) or ribosomal RNA depletion. RNA is fragmented and converted into cDNA.
  3. **Sequencing** (usually Illumina paired-end, 100‚Äì150 bp reads).
  4. **Quality control** of raw reads with FastQC.
  5. **Read alignment** to reference genome (using STAR, HISAT2) or **de novo transcriptome assembly** if no reference exists.
  6. **Quantification**: counting reads per gene or transcript (tools: featureCounts, Salmon, Kallisto).
  7. **Normalization** (TPM, FPKM, DESeq2 methods) to account for library size.
  8. **Differential expression analysis** (DESeq2, edgeR, limma).
  9. **Functional enrichment** (GO, KEGG) to interpret biological pathways.
* **Applications**: discovering differentially expressed genes (DEGs), alternative splicing, new transcripts, noncoding RNAs.

---

### **What is the main goal of RNA-seq?**

* To identify **which genes are expressed, at what level, and under which conditions**.
* Allows comparisons between conditions (e.g., control vs treatment) to find DEGs.
* Can also reveal isoform diversity, fusion transcripts, and allele-specific expression.

---

### **What are DEGs and why are they important?**

* **Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs)** = genes that show significant changes in expression between conditions.
* Identified by statistical tests correcting for sequencing depth and biological replicates.
* Importance:

  * Reveal **biological responses** (e.g., stress response, infection, drug treatment).
  * Link transcriptomic changes to phenotype.

---

### **What is GWAS and what is its main goal?**

* **GWAS = Genome-Wide Association Study**.
* Compares genetic variants (usually SNPs) across populations to identify loci associated with traits or diseases.
* **Main goal**: find correlations between genotype and phenotype at a population level.
* Example: Identify SNPs linked to type 2 diabetes in human populations.
* Requires large cohorts and careful population structure control.

---

### **Why does GWAS require population genomics?**

* GWAS relies on natural variation across many individuals.
* By comparing allele frequencies between case and control groups, statistical associations can be found.
* **Population size matters**: large, diverse samples increase power to detect small-effect variants.
* Must account for population stratification to avoid false positives.

---

### **What is Pool-seq and why is it used?**

* **Pool-seq** = sequencing DNA from pooled individuals rather than each one separately.
* Provides allele frequency estimates at a fraction of the cost of individual sequencing.
* **Applications**: population genomics in non-model species, experimental evolution, microbial populations.
* Limitation: loses individual genotype information.

---

### **What is methyl-seq and what does it detect?**

* **Methyl-seq (bisulfite sequencing)** = method to detect DNA methylation at single-base resolution.
* DNA is treated with sodium bisulfite:

  * Unmethylated cytosines are converted to uracil (read as thymine).
  * Methylated cytosines remain unchanged.
* Sequencing reveals methylated vs unmethylated cytosines.
* Applications: epigenetics, imprinting, cancer biology, gene regulation.

---

### **What is ChIP-seq and what does it study?**

* **ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing)** identifies binding sites of DNA-associated proteins (e.g., transcription factors, histones).
* Steps:

  1. Crosslink protein-DNA complexes in cells.
  2. Fragment DNA.
  3. Immunoprecipitate with antibody against the protein of interest.
  4. Purify DNA and sequence.
* Peaks in sequencing data indicate **protein binding sites** across the genome.
* Applications: mapping transcription factor networks, histone modifications, regulatory landscapes.

---

### **What is ATAC-seq and what does it measure?**

* **ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with sequencing)** detects open chromatin regions.
* Uses Tn5 transposase, which inserts sequencing adapters into accessible DNA.
* Sequencing identifies regions of open chromatin = potential regulatory elements (promoters, enhancers).
* Applications: epigenomics, developmental biology, cancer research.

---

### **What is Hi-C and what does it reveal?**

* **Hi-C** captures the 3D structure of the genome.
* Method: crosslink chromatin, cut DNA, ligate interacting fragments, sequence ligation products.
* Produces contact maps showing which regions of the genome interact.
* Applications:

  * Scaffolding genome assemblies to chromosome level.
  * Studying 3D genome organization (TADs, loops).

---

### **Why is RNA-seq complementary to genome annotation?**

* Provides **experimental evidence** for gene structures (exon-intron boundaries, alternative splicing).
* Supports ab initio predictions (validates which genes are truly expressed).
* Reveals condition-specific transcripts missed by annotation pipelines.

---

### **What is single-cell RNA-seq and what makes it powerful?**

* Profiles the transcriptomes of **individual cells**.
* Avoids averaging across populations, which masks heterogeneity.
* Applications:

  * Discover new cell types.
  * Track developmental trajectories.
  * Study tumor microenvironments.
* Requires specialized technologies (droplet-based sequencing, barcoding).

---

### **What are the main challenges of GWAS?**

* Requires very large cohorts to detect small-effect variants.
* Population structure can create false positives (spurious associations).
* Many SNPs fall in **noncoding regions**, making functional interpretation difficult.
* Complex traits often involve **many genes with small effects**.

---

### **What is epigenomics and why is it important?**

* Epigenomics = study of heritable modifications to DNA and chromatin that do not change the sequence.
* Includes DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility.
* Importance: regulates gene expression, cell identity, development, and disease.
