# README5 – Introduction to Genomics

## 1. Definition of Genomics

* **Genomics**: study of the complete DNA content (genome) of an organism.
* Involves **structure, function, evolution, and mapping** of genomes.
* Goes beyond single genes → considers all coding and noncoding regions.

---

## 2. Origins of Genomics

* **Human Genome Project (1990–2003)**: landmark international effort to sequence the entire human genome.
* Development of high-throughput sequencing technologies (NGS) enabled modern genomics.
* Shift from gene-level analysis → genome-wide analysis.

## 3. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)

* **Definition**: sequencing the entire DNA of an organism.

* **Steps**:

  1. DNA extraction.
  2. Library preparation (fragmentation + adapters).
  3. Sequencing (short-read or long-read platforms).
  4. Assembly (reads → contigs → scaffolds).
  5. Annotation (genes, repeats, regulatory regions).

* **Applications**:

  * Comparative genomics.
  * Evolutionary studies.
  * Clinical genomics & personalized medicine.
  * Biotechnology & synthetic biology.

## 4. Metadata in Genomics

* Metadata = contextual information about samples and sequencing.
* Examples:

  * Sample origin (organism, tissue, condition).
  * Sequencing platform (Illumina, ONT, PacBio).
  * Library type (paired-end, mate-pair, single-cell).
  * Project context (clinical, ecological, evolutionary).
* Importance: ensures reproducibility, facilitates data sharing.

## ✅ Summary

* Genomics = genome-wide study of DNA.
* Originated from the Human Genome Project, expanded with NGS.
* WGS workflow includes DNA extraction → sequencing → assembly → annotation.
* Metadata provides critical context for interpreting genomic data and enabling reproducibility.
