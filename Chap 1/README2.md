# README2 â€“ Molecular Genetics: Proof of Genes & Sequencing

## 1. Proof of the Chemical Nature of Genes

* **Experiments that established DNA as genetic material**:

  * **Griffith (1928)**: bacterial transformation (R and S strains of *Streptococcus pneumoniae*).
  * **Avery, MacLeod, McCarty (1944)**: DNA is the transforming principle.
  * **Hersheyâ€“Chase (1952)**: phage infection experiments showed DNA, not protein, enters cells.

ðŸ‘‰ Conclusion: **DNA is the molecule of heredity**.

## 2. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)

* Invented by Kary Mullis (1983).
* Purpose: amplify DNA fragments **in vitro**.
* **Steps**:

  1. **Denaturation** (\~95Â°C): DNA strands separate.
  2. **Annealing** (\~50â€“65Â°C): primers bind target.
  3. **Extension** (\~72Â°C): Taq polymerase extends new strand.
* Repeated cycles â†’ exponential amplification.
* Applications: diagnostics, forensics, cloning, sequencing.

## 3. Sanger Sequencing (Chain-Termination Method)

* Developed by Frederick Sanger (1977).
* Principle: incorporation of **dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs)** â†’ terminate DNA synthesis.
* Results: fragments of different lengths ending at each base.
* Run on capillary electrophoresis â†’ **electropherogram (chromatogram)** with colored peaks.
* Accuracy: \~99.99% (gold standard).
* Limitations: low throughput, max \~1000 bp per read.

## 4. Next-Generation Confirmation of Gene Nature

* PCR and Sanger sequencing provided **molecular evidence** that:

  * Genes are specific DNA sequences.
  * DNA sequence variation â†’ protein/trait variation.
* Transition from **gene-level study â†’ genome-wide study** (NGS, WGS).

---

## 5. Key Concepts in Molecular Genetics

* **Gene**: functional unit of heredity, DNA sequence encoding a protein or RNA.
* **Coding vs. non-coding DNA**: not all genes code proteins (tRNA, rRNA, regulatory RNAs).
* **Central Dogma**: DNA â†’ RNA â†’ Protein.
* **Mutations**: changes in DNA sequence leading to variation, sometimes disease.

---

## âœ… Summary

* DNA is the genetic material (Griffith â†’ Avery â†’ Hershey-Chase).
* **PCR** revolutionized molecular biology â†’ amplifying DNA easily.
* **Sanger sequencing** enabled the first DNA sequencing and is still used as a gold standard.
* These molecular tools laid the foundation for **modern genomics** and NGS.
