# README4 – Quantitative Genetics

## 1. Phenotype Definition

* **Phenotype (P)**: observable characteristics of an organism.
* Determined by **Genetics (G)** + **Environment (E)** + **G × E interactions**.
* Formula:
  **P = G + E**

---

## 2. Genetic Variance Components

* Genetic variance (VG) can be partitioned into:

  * **Additive variance (VA)**: effect of individual alleles (predictable, heritable).
  * **Dominance variance (VD)**: interactions between alleles at the same locus.
  * **Epistatic variance (VI)**: interactions between alleles at different loci.

Total phenotypic variance:
**VP = VG + VE + VGE**

## 3. Heritability

### Broad-sense heritability (H²)

* Fraction of phenotypic variance due to **all genetic variance**.
* Formula: **H² = VG / VP**

### Narrow-sense heritability (h²)

* Fraction of phenotypic variance due to **additive variance**.
* Formula: **h² = VA / VP**
* Important for predicting response to selection.

## 4. Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL)

* **QTLs**: genomic regions contributing to variation in a quantitative trait.
* Identified through linkage mapping or GWAS.
* Require both **phenotypic data** and **genotypic data**.
* Output: QTL maps showing trait-associated genomic intervals.

---

## 5. Applications

* **Plant/animal breeding**: estimate heritability, predict genetic gain, apply marker-assisted selection.
* **Medicine**: study genetic architecture of complex diseases (diabetes, heart disease).
* **Evolution**: understand natural selection on polygenic traits.

## ✅ Summary

* Phenotype is shaped by both genes and environment.
* Genetic variance can be decomposed into additive, dominance, and epistatic components.
* Heritability measures the genetic contribution to trait variance.
* QTL mapping and GWAS link genotypes to complex traits, crucial for breeding and medical genetics.
