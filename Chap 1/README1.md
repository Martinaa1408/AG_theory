# README1 – Branches of Genetics & Mendelian Foundations

## 1. The Main Branches of Genetics

### Classical Genetics

* Focus: transmission of traits from parents to offspring.
* Foundation: **Mendel’s laws** (segregation & independent assortment).
* Tools: pedigrees, Punnett squares, breeding experiments.
* Applications: inheritance patterns (dominant, recessive, sex-linked).

### Molecular Genetics

* Focus: chemical and molecular nature of genes.
* Genes as DNA sequences coding for proteins or functional RNAs.
* Tools: PCR, Sanger sequencing, cloning, CRISPR.
* Studies: replication, transcription, translation, mutation.

### Population Genetics

* Focus: allele and genotype frequencies in populations.
* Principles: **Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE)**, genetic drift, migration, selection.
* Tools: inbreeding coefficient, LD (linkage disequilibrium), ROH (runs of homozygosity).
* Applications: evolution, conservation genetics, GWAS.

### Quantitative Genetics

* Focus: continuous traits controlled by multiple loci.
* Phenotype = Genetics (G) + Environment (E).
* Tools: heritability estimates (H², h²), QTL mapping, variance decomposition.
* Applications: plant/animal breeding, complex disease genetics.

### Genomics

* Genome-wide perspective of structure and function.
* Technologies: NGS, long-read sequencing, WGS.
* Applications: genome assembly, annotation, functional and comparative genomics.

## 2. Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance

**First Law – Law of Segregation**

* Each individual carries two alleles per trait.
* Alleles segregate during gamete formation.
* Each gamete receives only one allele.

**Second Law – Law of Independent Assortment**

* Alleles of different genes assort independently during gamete formation.
* Exceptions: linkage (genes physically close on chromosomes).

## 3. Pedigree Analysis

* **Pedigrees**: graphical representation of inheritance across generations.
* Useful for studying:

  * Autosomal dominant traits (e.g., Huntington’s).
  * Autosomal recessive traits (e.g., cystic fibrosis).
  * X-linked traits (e.g., hemophilia).

**Symbols:**

* Square = male, Circle = female.
* Filled = affected, Empty = unaffected.
* Line through = deceased.

## 4. Cell Division and Chromosome Behavior

### Mitosis

* Purpose: growth, repair, asexual reproduction.
* Produces 2 identical diploid cells.
* Maintains chromosome number.

### Meiosis

* Purpose: gamete formation.
* Produces 4 non-identical haploid cells.
* Reduces chromosome number (diploid → haploid).
* Involves recombination and independent assortment.

## 5. Cytogenetics & Chromosomal Maps

* **Cytogenetics**: study of chromosomes and their structure.
* **Karyotype**: chromosome complement of a cell.
* **Chromosomal maps**: indicate gene locations based on:

  * Cytogenetic banding (G-bands).
  * Genetic maps (recombination frequency).
  * Physical maps (DNA sequence coordinates).

## 6. Linkage and Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)

* **Linkage**: genes close on the same chromosome are inherited together.
* **Recombination frequency** used to estimate distance between loci.
* **LD (Linkage Disequilibrium)**: non-random association of alleles at different loci in a population.

  * Caused by limited recombination, selection, or demographic history.
  * Measured with statistics D', r².
* Important in **GWAS** and mapping complex traits.

## ✅ Summary

* **Genetics branches**: classical (inheritance), molecular (DNA-level), population (allele dynamics), quantitative (complex traits), genomics (whole genome).
* **Mendel’s laws** are the basis of inheritance but modified by linkage and recombination.
* **Pedigrees, mitosis, meiosis, cytogenetics, linkage, and LD** connect classical genetics to modern genomics.
